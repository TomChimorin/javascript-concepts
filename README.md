# JavaScript Concepts and Follow-Along Projects

## üìå Description
This repository contains JavaScript concept practice files covering everything from fundamentals to advanced topics. All content was developed while learning from BroCode‚Äôs JavaScript Full Course video on YouTube.

In addition to individual concept files, this repo includes a few small **follow-along projects**, where I applied what I was learning in real time.
